To do:

- Fix bug where you click on a cell WITH a tile already on it, AND have a selected tile in hand, the selected tile disappears (needs to be sent back to rack)
- Fix bug where after removing a tile off a cell, that cell no longer accepts tiles
- Define rules for placement: 
    ✔ First word has to touch center
    - All words thereafter have to be attached to another word
- Execute checks on PLAY
- Let player switch order of tiles on rack
✔ Tiles with two digit points are only displaying the first digit on borad (key[1] needs to be be key[1, 2] perhaps?)
